    <h1>Features of Y2018-Text</h1>
    <hr width="100%" size="2">
    <h2>21-bit character encoding</h2>
    <p>To make 21-bit (Unicode codepoint) text handling workable in a
      ADA programming language. The solution is to implement types<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Codepoint - a scalar type with a range 0 .. 2097151 to present
        all Unicode codepoints<br>
      </li>
      <li>CFix - an array of Codepoints</li>
      <li>CVar - a <u><i>variable length array</i></u> of codepoints,
        which is a type from a package and works in similar way as
        Ada.Strings.Unbounded.Unbounded_String, but with a much shorter
        name "CVar" than the "Unbounded_String".<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Function for handling types above <a href="t020.html">Text in
        Y2018.Text.Core</a><br>
    </p>
    To scan a ASCII file as hexadecimal or as text has been done since
    the 50-ties but to get view of a possible UTF-8 coded file more
    problematic. It may be a UTF-8 coded file but it is possible that
    the file also contains non-UTF-8 'characters'. <br>
    <hr width="100%" size="2">
    <h2>Regular expression </h2>
    <p>The <a href="t004.html">implementation</a>.</p>
    <p>For text handling we have <u>Regular Expression</u> like what is
      found in Perl language but this is ADA not Perl. We are not
      following ICU standard of Unicode.org in our solution or C++ or
      Java regular expression implementations. The regular expression is
      implemented in package Y2018.Text.Jets and it's subpackages and
      works with an index pair (<font color="#999900">type I_A is array
        (1..2) of Integer</font>). Where the first value refers to the
      starting point and the second to the endpoint of an array of type
      CFix. Only existing option is the posibility to search for strings
      independent of case.<br>
    </p>
    <hr width="100%" size="2">
    <p> </p>
    <h2>GC, RangeVector, MapPools &amp; features made from Unicode files<br>
    </h2>
    <p>The <a href="t047.html">'\p'</a> implementation.</p>
    <p> In this regular expression the '\p{}' notation holds many
      features that is not obvious but is central for the support. The
      '\p{}' notation is much more restricted than in Java or C++
      (Unicode.org ICU).<br>

    <h2>Debug and test support </h2>
    <p>Functions for <a href="t015.html">testing and debugging</a> and
      support for the change from <i><u>TEST</u></i> to <u><i>Quality
          Assurance</i></u> environments (by removing debug code from
      ads- and adb-files). </p>
